Sure! Here's a simple and detailed explanation of the Cookie Cats project:

---

### What is Cookie Cats?  
Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game where players progress through levels by solving puzzles. In the game, there's a concept called a "gate." A gate is a checkpoint that players need to pass to continue to the next set of levels. To open the gate, players might need to wait a certain time or pay with in-game currency.

---

### What was the Problem?  
The developers wanted to know if changing the position of the first gate in the game (from **level 30 to level 40**) would impact how long players stay in the game (player retention) and how many game rounds they play.  

To figure this out, they decided to conduct an **A/B test**.  
- **Control Group**: These players experienced the original version of the game, with the gate at level 30.  
- **Test Group**: These players experienced a new version of the game, with the gate moved to level 40.  

The goal was to analyze if players in the test group stayed longer or played more compared to the control group.

### What Did I Do?  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   The dataset included 90,189 players, with information like:
   - When they started playing.
   - How many game rounds they completed.
   - Whether they returned to the game after one day (1-day retention).
   - Whether they returned after seven days (7-day retention).

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:  
   - Checked for missing values or errors in the data.  
   - Made sure the control and test groups were balanced in size and characteristics.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   - The hypothesis was: *Moving the gate to level 40 will improve player retention and increase the number of rounds played.*  
   - Used statistical tests to compare the control and test groups:
     - **Shapiro Test**: Checked if the data was normally distributed.  
     - **Levene Test**: Checked if the two groups had similar variances.  
     - **T-Test/Welch Test/Mann-Whitney U Test**: Compared metrics like retention rates and rounds played.

4. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Created charts and graphs to visualize differences between the control and test groups for:
     - 1-day and 7-day retention rates.  
     - Average rounds played.

5. **Analysis and Insights**:  
   - Found out if moving the gate to level 40 improved or worsened retention and gameplay.  
   - Based on the results, I provided recommendations on whether the new gate placement should be implemented permanently.

### What Were the Results?  
- The test showed whether moving the gate had a **positive, negative, or neutral impact** on player behavior.  
- The findings helped the developers make a data-driven decision about the game design.

### Why Was This Important?  
This project helped the game developers understand player behavior and decide if a simple change like gate placement could improve player engagement. This kind of analysis can influence in-game monetization strategies and overall user experience.
